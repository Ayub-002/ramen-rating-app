Ramen Rating App
Welcome to the Ramen Rating App! This is a simple web application that allows users to view, rate, and add ramen dishes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app dynamically updates the menu based on user interaction. It's designed to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and form submission without relying on a server.

Features
Display Ramen Dishes: View a list of ramen dishes with their images.
Ramen Details: Clicking a ramen image displays its name, restaurant, rating, and comment.
Add New Ramen: Users can submit a new ramen dish via a form, which will be dynamically added to the ramen menu.
Dynamic Updates: The ramen menu is updated in real time based on user input.
